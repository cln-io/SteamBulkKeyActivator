##VAC anti-cheat concerns

Q:Is this allowed ? Can I get banned for this ? 

A:Ofcourse,never.

This script is written in AutoHotKey  
http://ahkscript.org/
>AutoHotkey (AHK) is a free, open-source macro-creation and automation software for Windows that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a scripting language that was initially aimed at providing keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys, that over time evolved into a full-fledged scripting language. 

This is a script that automates the repetitive task of activating steam keys. as this does not inject anything whatsoever you don't have to worry about VAC.
